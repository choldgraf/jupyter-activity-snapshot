# Jupyter Activity Update

This book shows **recent activity in the Jupyter ecosystem on GitHub**.


Each page to the left has a report for one Jupyter GitHub organization.
Browse the content to see what Jovyans have been up to!

## How this works

The data is updated roughly periodically and contains information about the
last 60 days of activity, using the [github-activity package](https://github.com/choldgraf/github-activity)
to scrap the data, [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) to build a book out of
the analyses, and [this GitHub Action](https://github.com/choldgraf/jupyter-activity-snapshot/blob/master/.github/workflows/book.yml)
to scrape the data and build the book before pushing to GitHub Pages.

See [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/choldgraf/jupyter-activity-snapshot) for
more code and data!
